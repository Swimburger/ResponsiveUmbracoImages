# Sample to create Responsive Images in Umbraco using an Umbraco Macro
To log in use 'admin@admin.admin' as email and 'admin@admin.admin' as password.

There's 3 macro's included in this project, each building on the previous:
1. ResponsiveImage: Macro using picture + source elements to serve multiple resolutions & sizes
2. ResponsiveImageHighDPI: Macro using picture + source elements to serve multiple resolutions, sizes, and high dpi versions when possible
3. ResponsiveImageHighDPIWithWebp: Macro using picture + source elements to serve multiple resolutions, sizes, and high dpi versions when possible, and webp

All HTML uses web capabilities that are progressive enhancements that fallback safely if not supported.
